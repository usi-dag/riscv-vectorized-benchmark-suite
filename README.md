# RiVEC Bencmark Suite

## Overview

The RiVEC Benchmark Suite is a collection composed of data-parallel applications from different domains. The suite focuses on benchmarking vector microarchitectures; nevertheless, it can be used as well for Multimedia SIMD microarchitectures. Current implementation is targeting RISC-V Architectures; however, it can be easily ported to any Vector/SIMD ISA thanks to a wrapper library which we developed to map vector intrinsics and math functions to the target architecture.

The benchmark suite with all its applications and input sets is available as open source free of charge. Some of the benchmark programs have their own licensing terms which might limit their use in some cases.

Currently there are two implementations based on the Working draft of the proposed RISC-V V vector extension [v0.7](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/0.7.1) and [v1.0](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-v-spec):

## Building Vectorized Applications 


### LLVM Compiler 

We provide precompiled binaries found in the folder bin. However, it is possible to recompile the codes for both rvv versions (0.7 and 1.0).
To compile for [rvv-0.7](https://github.com/RALC88/riscv-vectorized-benchmark-suite/tree/rvv-0.7) it is possible to use the [LLVM EPI Compiler](https://ssh.hca.bsc.es/epi/ftp/?C=M;O=D). The provided binaries were compiled with the version llvm-EPI-0.7-development-toolchain-cross-2021-02-23-1523. Note that the compiler is actively in development, so after a certain time, the old versions will disappear. We recommend to use the latest version.

To compile for [rvv-1.0](https://github.com/RALC88/riscv-vectorized-benchmark-suite/tree/rvv-1.0) it is possible to use the [LLVM from PLCT](https://github.com/isrc-cas/rvv-llvm)

### EPI builtins reference

Here you can find the [EPI Builtins reference for rvv-0.7](https://repo.hca.bsc.es/gitlab/rferrer/epi-builtins-ref/-/tree/EPI-0.7) used to target RISC-V V-extension.

### Intel Intrinsics Guide

Here you can find the [Intel Intrinsics Guide for AVX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/intrinsics-guide/index.html#) used to target AVX-512 architecture. 

### Setting up the environment

The Suite includes a makefile to compile every application, in order to use it, you must define the path to the RISC-V vector compiler.

Setting the Vector Compiler path
```
export LLVM=$TOP/epi-toolchain
export PATH=$PATH:$LLVM/bin
```
To use Intel intrinsics version compile with GCC or Clang with (to use Clang you need first to change
the Makefile for each benchmark)
```shell
export GCC=$TOP/usr
export PATH=$PATH:$GCC/bin
```

Possible target options
```shell
gcc -march=native -Q --help=target
```

### Compile using  clang for RISCV Vector Version

To compile any application run the command make followed by the application name
```
make application 
```
For example to compile blackscholes:
```
make blackscholes 
```
The same for the other applications ...

Also you can compile all the applications by typing:
```
make all 
```

### Running applications

There are provided 5 different simulation sizes (arguments to run the application). Assuming that the application is running on a simulator, is recommended to not use "native" simulation size.
```
simtiny : takes seconds to be executed on gem5
simsmall : takes around 15-30 minutes to be executed on gem5
simmedium : takes around 1-2  hour to be executed on gem5
simlarge : takes around 8-24 hours to be executed on gem5
native : only for native hardware
```

Whe you are executing an application, you must write the following arguments to run a predefined simsize.
#### simtiny 
```
blackscholes_args   = "1 input/in_512.input output_prices.txt"
canneal_args        = "1 100 300 input/100.nets 8"

streamcluster_args  = "10 20 128 8192 8192 1000 none output.txt 1"
swaptions_args      = "-ns 64 -sm 16384 -nt 1"
particlefilter_args = "-x 128 -y 128 -z 24 -np 8192"
